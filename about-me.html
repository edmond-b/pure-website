    <h1 class="title">About Me</h1>
    <p>Form me the move into the tech industry was a recent one. Like most people, I spent my formative years trying to figure out where I belonged and what I wanted to do in life. For me, that search took longer than I had anticipated. I worked a wide variety of jobs and left university with a certificate of higher education in Engineering & Mathematics before I found my way to the programming world. I can now say that I have found something that I love doing, but I could not have done it without the help of a great many people.</br></p>
