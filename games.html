            Game design has always been a passion of mine and now that I possess the tools
            necessary to create 3D worlds I have started a long term project to create my own
            masterpiece.
            <br>
            The game is being made using the Unity engine and it will feature a
            planet hopping adventure with dual stick shooter gameplay.
            <br>
            Game development - especially solo dev - is both extreamly challenging and rewarding
            as it involves many different disciplines from art and music to logic and algorithms.
            <br>
            I hope that one day this will make it to the steam pages.

            Run Boris, Run is a Super Mario style side scroller that I worked on as my
            final project for Makers Academy. It was completed in less that two weeks using only
            vanilla JavaScript for the game - that means we had to code in everything from
            physics to animations - and React for the site layout.
            <br>
            I'm very proud of this
            as it is the first game that I've deployed for the public to play.
            You can play the game at the link bellow and check out the GitHub page to see
            some of the tech used.
